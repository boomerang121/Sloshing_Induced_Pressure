# Reducing Sloshing Induced Pressure using Baffles | ( Prof. Swapnadip De Chowdhury )  
• Implemented baffles, reduced sloshing-induced pressure by 70%, translating to significant cost savings and minimized liabilities
• Enhanced capacity with SPH simulations in FORTRAN, optimizing storage & financial efficiency by spreading impact over 150% time-span
• Utilized MATLAB's Statistics, ML and Signal Processing Toolboxes for pressure visualization and optimal baffle height for pressure reduction
• Analyzed simulation data against theoretical models and achieved 91% accuracy, indicating financial viability & risk mitigation in baffles usage
